Hello!
If you are here to review my code, allow me to point you in the right direction!

The main file you'll want to be looking for is template/js/script.js.
This file has all of the functionality for build a bug.

template/css/style.css is the file that makes build a bug look the way it does. 
It contains all of the classes that script.js calls for.

index.html is the file you'd open if you wanted to run build a bug.
It is a website with the basic structure of the game.
